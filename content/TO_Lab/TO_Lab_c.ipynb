    "# The P-Norm Stress Aggregation\n",
    "We all want a little less stress in our lives, but how much? A loaded structure will have some stress, no matter what. If we changed our problem to 'minimise stress' as the objective, we would end up with no structure - the least stressed structure is no structure at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we shall add stress as a constraint in a similar way to volume / weight, using a limiting factor. You might be thinking - \"let's limit it to yield stress\". But checking the stress of every element is computationally expensive and is not differentiable, so we can't get the sensitivity value out of it. Therefore we use an approximation for large stresses in the design field. One way is called p-norm stress aggregation, which sums up all the local stress values into a single global value. Similar to SIMP, it uses a penalty-like factor called p-norm, we raise the elemental stress to it's power, sum these values up across the domain and then inverse the power to get a more sensible value. We can increase the value of p-norm to increase the contribution of higher stresses, and as p-norm tends to infinity, the value of the aggregation tends towards the maximum value.\n",
